# Body-Performance-Categorization-Project

This project categorizes subjects based on numerous physical stats into a body performance class from A-D, with A as the best class and D as the worst. The model created to fit the data is a multi-layer perception classifier from the sklearn library, which is a supervised neural network model for categorization. By splitting data into training and testing data, the accuracy can be determined to be ~74%, which is visualized in the confusion matrix shown below. The user can input their own stats to then determine their own boy performance category using this program.
